## About

* Part 1: Improvment of model from semester A - Bank Churn Model 

The purpose of this notebook is to take a classification model I made last semester and improve it. This is made possible through the models and methods learned during the current semester: dimensionality reduction by PCA, clustering by K-Means, ensemble learning, etc.

* Part 2: Fashion Mnist Dataset

This is a multivariate classification problem with ten different types of fashion items that we need to classify. The success rates in this issue are quite high because the images are beautifully arranged. Accordingly, we would like to create a compact model that requires as few pixels as possible in order to successfully classify our labels.

* Part 3: Dogs VS Cats Dataset

In this part, we will get a huge amount of pictures of dogs and cats. Some are simple and nice pictures and some are pictures that can be very confusing to a computer. We will try to find for us a model that will do its best to classify between pictures of dogs and cats. Recall that even in this part, the use of deep learning methods is prohibited, although they are the leading methods today in the image classification process. According to the knowledge we have earned, we will try to maximize the capabilities of machine learning in order to build the best mode we can offer.

* Part 4: Hands sync

We will try to classify all kinds of hand movements according to the situation they were in. That is, we would like to classify in which situation the person was when he moved his hands. Did he stand alone in an empty room and move them as he pleased? Did he stand in front of another person and move his hands freely? Or he actually moved his hands in front of another person while trying to synchronize with him.
